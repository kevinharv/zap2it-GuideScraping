- Verify file paths are Docker compatible
- Organize file system (create output, base files, log files)
- Create entrypoint.sh (call the script at the time interval specified by environment)

Added the -f flag to assist with finding the headendId and lineupId for various providers.
Added an optional [lineup] section to the config to accomodate loading data for non-OTA providers
The script will attempt to derive the lineupId from data available, but the headendId is buried deeper and must be set manually if changing providers.
The 'device' field has also been added to the [lineup] config section and is supported in the script

Docker isn't my strongest area so I'm not sure of the exact usecase, but I've created a VERY basic Dockerfile 
Basic Docker Support:
Run the following commands from the root of this repo in Windows(PowerShell) or linux:
<pre>
docker build -t zap2it:latest .
docker run -v ${PWD}:/guide zap2it
</pre>
Running the script like this will read zap2itconfig.ini from the host current directory and output the .xmltv files to the host current directory.
